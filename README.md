<h1 style="color:green">JET BOOKING</h1>

* Its a simple project for Jet booking system it only has 10 seats available. for that i created a JSON file as the seats were occupied it show seat reserved and update the value of the seat "true" in JSON file so noone can reserve that seat again.
* In the starting it ask for a login or signup. i created this type of authentication using JSON file. if the username exist in JSON it shows "User Already Exist". if its a new user it asked for a password and create a data in JSON file for that user. So it can login with the same credential again.
*  After login it ask for your name, email and age for seat reservation then it shows a list of seats available and seats which were occupied. user have to select one seta. if it is not occupied than its shows "Seat Reserverd" otherwise it show "seat already reserved".
*  Enjoy
